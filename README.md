# 3D Image registration based on Simple Elastix

Here are different image registration programs using simple Elastix for registering 3D volumes. 

- Reg2volumes: takes fixed and moving images (and masks if available) and performs rigid or non-rigid registration
- Reg2volumes_roi: idem as previous but doing a bit more pre-processing (masking the fixed image with the mask region)

Other tools:
- mask_volume: masks a given volume 
- diff_images: makes a signed difference between two images/volumes
- transform_vol: transforms a volume given the input transform parameters
